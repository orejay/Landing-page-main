# My Landing Page Project  
This project combines HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a dynamic landing page.  
I used the HTML and CSS starter files provided.  
I have added JavaScript to dynamically add items to the navigation bar depending on how many  sections are on the page.  
The section in view is highlighted as well as the corresponding navigation link.  
When a navigation link is clicked the page is scrolled smoothly to the corresponding section.
